About Writing C/C++ Codes on Raspberry Pi Pico
=================================================

For beginners, writing code for Raspberry Pi Pico with Python, MicroPython or CircuitPython is an easy way.

What if you want to write in C/C++?

The Raspberry Pi provides C/C++ SDK for the Raspberry Pi Pico，which contains detailed `documentation <https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf>`_, 
but not suitable for beginners.

While Arduino is an excellent option for beginners who would like to write C/C++. But Arduino is still porting Pico for the Arduino IDE.

Luckily Earle F. Philhower, III published an unofficial support! He has developed the `Raspberry Pi Pico Arduino core <https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to 
add support for the Raspberry Pi Pico to the Arduino IDE. https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


And then, using this repository, **tom'sHARDWARE** published a complete tutorial on setting up Arduino IDE for Raspberry Pi Pico on both Windows and Ubuntu.

If you can’t wait for the official one, try it out! As soon as Arduino officially release Raspberry Pi Pico port, we will update detailed lessons.
